    "text": "1.1.1 Everyone\n\nDo work that you are proud of. If you’re really passionate about your research and you work hard at it, that makes a huge difference.\nDouble (even triple!) check your work. Being a little obsessive is essential to good science.\n\nEveryone makes mistakes… the difference between a novice and an expert is that an expert acknowledges this and is meticulous.\nIf you do find a mistake, always tell your collaborators as soon as you can (and simultaneously work to fix the mistake). This is important at any stage of a project – even if the paper has already been written, and even if it has already been submitted!\nWe admit our mistakes, we correct them, and we learn from them. And then we move on.\n\nFulfill your commitments. Understand expectations for your time in the lab, and ask Jeff if you have questions about them. Then complete those commitments, including attending all experiment appointments and meetings. Let Jeff or other teammates know as soon as possible if you’re unable to make and appointment/meeting.\nBe supportive of your labmates. We are a team.\n\nOffer help even if you aren’t on the project. Help others and you can expect others to help you when you need it.\n\nWork independently when you can; ask for help when you need it.\nShare your knowledge. Mentorship can take many forms.\nRespect each others’ strengths, weaknesses, differences, and beliefs.\nScience is a marathon, not a sprint. Take personal time/vacation when you need it, and cultivate a life outside of the lab. Respect that other lab members also have a life outside of lab.\nCommunicate openly and respectfully with other members of the lab.\nIf you’re struggling, tell someone (feel free to tell Jeff!). Your health and happiness are important. It’s OK to go through tough patches (we all do!), but don’t feel shy about asking for help or needing to vent.\nIf you have an issue with another lab member that cannot be solved by talking with them about it, please talk with Jeff. Tension and hostility in the lab are toxic for the group dynamic. Jeff is here to help with any and all of these issues, and the sooner, the better!\nIf you have an issue with Jeff and feel comfortable talking with him about it, please do! If you’re not comfortable with that, please reach out to another member of the psychology department who can intervene (this can be a grad student for smaller lab issues or another faculty member for more serious issues). Mike Dodd and Maital Neta have agreed to be resources for lab members to approach.\nStay up-to-date on the latest research, either by RSS feeds, getting journal table of contents, or following scientists on Twitter/Mastodon.\nAcademia may feel different from other types of jobs, but it is still a job. You should treat coming into lab with the same respect that you would treat any other position. There are going to be aspects about the job you like more than others, but all are required.\nConduct with the PI and other faculty:\n\nYou may notice that Jeff is often quite casual in speech/behavior. That said, please remember that he is a faculty member and head of the lab, has extensive academic experience, and a Ph.D. In that way, he is ‘senior’ (meaning in experience and power), and a good general rule is to behave formally with senior folks until you have a good handle on the appropriate level of casualness. Jeff hopes to be friendly with everyone, but his specific role is Lab PI and this will always take priority and precedence over any friend role.\n\nConduct with other trainees and students:\n\nIt is important to maintain a professional, friendly environment. You may not like someone else, but it should not be apparent in the lab! Whether you are more junior, more senior, someone’s supervisor, someone’s supervisee, etc., you should make a continued and conscious effort to work with others in a productive and collegial way. If you notice someone seems “left out” or uncomfortable, please make an effort to include them. Respect your supervisors, whether they are faculty or a student.\nA lab can be competitive, where people strive to outdo each other, or collaborative, where people strive to help each other do their best. Labs can be competitive or collaborative with other labs as well. Our lab is intentionally collaborative. Each of us has a finite skill/knowledge set, and working with others gives each of us access to more information and abilities. So, helping others is important in the lab, and Jeff considers this as an important part of your performance. Other peoples’ successes reflect upon you as yours will reflect upon them.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 PI\nAll of the above, plus you can expect me to:\n\nMaintain a vision of where the lab is going.\nProvide the funding necessary to keep the lab going.\nMeet with you regularly to discuss your research projects. The definition of “regularly” may change over time or over the course of a project.\nGive you feedback on a timely basis, including feedback on project ideas, conference posters, talks, manuscripts, figures, grants.\nGive you my perspective on academia and issues related to professional development, and generally help you prepare for the next step of your career, whether that’s grad school, postdoc, faculty job, or job outside of academia.\nSupport your career development by introducing you to other researchers in the field, writing recommendation letters for you, providing you with opportunities to attend conferences when finances permit, and promoting your work in talks.\nCare about you as a person and not just a scientist.\nThere are going to be aspects of your work that are fun, some that are challenging, and others that are downright painful (e.g., getting a manuscript rejected). I will always do my best to help you weather the ups and downs (and celebrate the ups!), but I will never let you shy away from the hard stuff… that is where the most learning and growth happens. Expect that I will support you but push you.\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Graduate students\nAll of the Everyone expectations above, plus you will be expected to:\n\nDevelop a line of dissertation research. Ideally, your dissertation research will consist of at least three related experiments that can be packaged into three chapters of one thesis document.\nHelp train and mentor others (lab managers, undergraduate and graduate students) on their research projects – either because they ask or because I ask you to.\n\nWork with a team of undergraduate students. This will speed up data collection and give you some experience with managing and mentoring a team.\n\nPresent your work at departmental events, at other labs (if invited), and at conferences.\nApply for external funding (e.g., NSF GRFP or NRSA). If nothing else, this is a valuable experience. Ask others who have received funding for successful examples.\nDo some soul-searching as to what type of career you want to pursue, e.g., academic jobs that are research-focused or teaching-focused, non-academic jobs like data science or science writing. Research-focused academic jobs are hard. They require a lot of work to prepare for, are rare and competitive to get, and require a lot of work to be successful. You must be super passionate about doing research and willing to work a lot for a long time to have a successful career. If you have qualms about this, you should consider other careers. And you may or may not need a Ph.D. for these careers. Talk to Jeff for help brainstorming ways of making sure you are getting the training that you need.\nMake sure you meet all departmental deadlines (e.g., for your exams and thesis) – even if your peers are missing these deadlines! And make sure Jeff is aware of them! And you are responsible for knowing about deadlines. Keep up-to-date with the PhD path.\nPrioritize time for research. Coursework or TA-ing are important, but ultimately your research is what earns you your Ph.D. and prepares you for the next stage of your (even non-academic) career.\n\nTalk to Jeff about coursework you’re considering (if not required).\n\nAttend all relevant lab meetings or let Jeff know if you can’t.\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Undergraduate researchers\nAll of the Everyone expectations above, plus you will be expected to:\n\nAssist other lab members with data collection or analysis (typically you will be assigned to particular projects), unless you are working on your own independent project under the mentorship of Jeff or another lab member, in which case, you should work on that.\nWork with your research mentor to determine your weekly schedule. If you are not able to come in during your normal scheduled time, you must let the lab manager know with as much advance notice as possible.\nAttend and participate in all lab meetings. Let Jeff or a grad student know if you can’t attend.\nIf you are earning course credit for research, you must additionally:\n\nWrite a short essay on your research topic or experiences due by the end of dead week.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.5 UCARE students\nAll of the Everyone and Undergraduate researchers expectations above, plus you will be expected to:\n\nSubmit a UCARE proposal, having sent a draft proposal to me at least two weeks before the deadline. Decide whether to participate in the lab during the summer or just the academic year.\nWork on the UCARE project for 10 hours per week during the academic year and 20 hours per week during summer (if you choose to work over the summer). If you cannot commit to the required effort or if you ability to meet the commitment changes, let Jeff know as soon as possible.\nMeet all UCARE deadlines.\nPresent a poster at one conference/meeting during the semester. Typically, this is the Nebraska Research Days in the spring, but it can also be the Nebraska Psychological Association meeting or another appropriate meeting.\n\n\n\n1.1.6 Lab technicians\nAll of the Everyone expectations above, plus you will be expected to:\n\nFulfill your duties as a lab technician.\nBe in the lab as needed. You may need to work some irregular hours if participating in an outreach event.\nOversee training of undergraduate research assistants in your area.\nHelp new lab members adjust to the lab by answering whatever questions they have that you can answer. If you can’t answer, direct their questions to Jeff.\nMaintain the lab paperwork (e.g., protocols, media waviers).\nMaintain the lab calendars, manage the lab shared data folders and check the lab email address.\nGive new lab members access to the lab calendar, lab Git repository, and add their experiments to the lab shared data folder.\nHelp to maintain an atmosphere of professionalism within the lab.\nTell Jeff – as soon as it becomes even a minor issue – if there are any issues with undergraduates who are having trouble fulfilling their commitments to the lab.\nAssist Jeff with the day-to-day running of lab operations, including responding to any requests that Jeff sends along (urgent requests as indicated by Jeff should be responded to immediately).\nDevelop with Jeff your own research project if applicable.",

All lab members must read and abide by the UNL policies on discrimination and harassment.\nThe lab is committed to ensuring a safe, friendly, and accepting environment for everybody. We will not tolerate any verbal or physical harassment or discrimination on the basis of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, political orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We will not tolerate intimidation, stalking, following, unwanted photography or video recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery are generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions. Finally, it should go without saying that lewd language and behavior have no place in the lab, including any lab outings.\nHarassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated and will result in the harasser being asked immediately to leave the lab and subjected to any and all university and legal sanctions.\nIf you notice someone being harassed, or are harassed yourself, tell Jeff immediately. If Jeff is the cause of your concern, then reach out to the Department Chair or another trusted faculty member in the department.

    "text": "2.1.1 Scientific integrity\n\nResearch misconduct\nThe lab, and UNL, is committed to ensuring research integrity, and we take a hard line on research misconduct. We will not tolerate fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism. Read UNL’s Responsible Conduct of Research policy and their Research Misconduct policy.\nIf you are feeling pressured to succeed (publish a lot, publish in high impact journals), you should reach out to Jeff and we can talk about it – but this pressure is something we all face and is never an excuse to fabricate, falsify, or plagiarize. Also, think about the goal of science and why you are here: you’re here to arrive at the truth, to get as close as we can to facts about human and non-human behavior. Not only is research misconduct doing you a disservice, it’s also a disservice to the field. And it risks your entire career. It is never right and never worth it. Don’t do it.\n\n\nOpen science\nOur policy on open science is simple: we share all data, materials, and code upon posting a preprint or publishing a paper, whenever possible. Sometimes there are circumstances where we cannot do this (e.g., we do not own the data, so we are legally obligated to keep it private; or we need to hold off on public sharing until a paper is published to avoid getting scooped). Because of this, you must have explicit permission from Jeff to post data, materials, or code publicly. More details are available in Reproducible research and open science.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Authorship\nWe will follow APA guidelines with respect to authorship:\n\nAuthorship credit should reflect the individual’s contribution to the study. An author is considered anyone involved with initial research design, data collection and analysis, manuscript drafting, and final approval. However, the following do not necessarily qualify for authorship: providing funding or resources, mentorship, or contributing research but not helping with the publication itself. The primary author assumes responsibility for the publication, making sure that the data are accurate, that all deserving authors have been credited, that all authors have given their approval to the final draft; and handles responses to inquiries after the manuscript is published.\n\nWe use the CRediT system to specify various types of contributions to a project (e.g., conceptualization, project administration, supervision, data analysis, writing). Authorship will be discussed prior to the beginning of a new project, so that expectations are clearly defined. In general, I expect that graduate students will be first authors on publications on which they are the primary lead, and I will be the last author. Talk to Jeff right away if you aren’t sure if you are first author. Our lab has a pretty liberal policy for including undergraduate assistants as authors. Assistants who take the lead in running projects or contributing above and beyond data collection are often invited to be authors. These discussions and decisions will be spearheaded by the first author, in consultation with Jeff. However, changes to authorship may occur over the course of a project if a new person becomes involved or if someone is not fulfilling their planned role. For example, if a student hands a project off to another lab member, they will most likely lose first-authorship to the new project leader. If a student collects a dataset but does not completely analyze it and write it up, Jeff will re-assign the project (if appropriate) to another person (who will become first author) to expedite publication.\nAll of these issues will be discussed openly, and you should feel free to bring them up if you are not sure of your authorship status or want to discuss it. Again, these discussions should be addressed with the first author, but Jeff is always happy to help with negotiations should the need arise.\n\n\n2.1.3 Human subjects and animal research\nBecause we are engaged in human subjects and animal research, it is of the utmost importance that we adhere to our approved IRB and IACUC protocols. Non-adherence to these protocols can lead to severe consequences for the entire lab (i.e., we may lose permission to conduct any research!). All lab members must read and comply with the IRB consent form and research summary for any project that they are working on. Lab members must also complete the CITI training and be added to the research personnel list before they can work with subjects. If there are any questions about the protocols, or if you’re not sure whether we have approval to run your study, please ask the project manager or me for clarification. If necessary, we can file an amendment to an existing protocol or create a new protocol. But you must not deviate from the protocol unless you have been specifically instructed to do so by Jeff or your supervisor.\nIf you encounter any problems in the course of doing research that results in a negative outcome for the participant (e.g., if a participant becomes ill or upset, if there is an accident with the equipment, if there is a breach of confidentiality, etc) or animal subject, you should immediately seek assistance from Jeff or the project manager. If Jeff is not around, you must notify him within 24 hours, preferably as soon as possible. In some cases, we may need to report this information to the IRB, IACUC, and/or our funding agencies.\n\n\n2.1.4 Confidentiality\nAll research data and materials in the lab are assumed to be confidential until they are publicly shared and should be treated as such. Our IRB reviews our research practices to ensure that only approved personnel have access to data. It is your responsibility to ensure that confidential materials are never made available to unapproved individuals. This means, for instance, that you must:\n\nnever share your login credentials to lab resources with outside individuals;\nnever distribute passwords, which could compromise the confidentiality of our data and materials;\nnever discuss or share any participant information outside the lab, including identifiable information (like people’s names or contact information), performance in studies, correspondence with parents, and so on;\nnever store confidential materials on personal computers or phones;\nwhen using data outside the lab, ensure that you delete all local copies after using them, and ensure that no one other than you can view or access data (including videos); and\nnever allow unapproved individuals to enter the lab unaccompanied, and if such an individual is in the lab, ensure they cannot access any confidential information.\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Photos & videos\nWe respect the privacy and comfort of lab members by only taking photos or video recordings of them with their explicit knowledge and consent. This is especially important in situations where a lab member would otherwise not be aware of you taking a photo and therefore cannot object if they do not want you to (e.g., using a still from a video while they are participating in an experiment). To avoid ambiguity about when a lab member is vs. is not aware of photos being taken, you must obtain direct consent from lab members before taking photos or videos, and obtain consent again before posting any images on social media.\nNote that this also applies to our research participants. Unless a participant explicitly asks you to do so, you may not photograph your participant during an experiment (aside from an official video record of the experiment).\nFinally, lab members are not allowed to photograph or video record subjects in the animal research areas. Dog owners may consent to having their dog’s photo taken for posting on social media. Dog owners are allowed to photograph their dogs in our lab.\n\n\n2.1.6 Diversity and inclusion\nWe hope to make the lab a diverse working environment. We recruit people from a variety of backgrounds who have a variety of perspectives, life and professional experiences, skills, and interests. However, the lab is small enough that all lab members are likely to be an exclusive member of some sort of group, whether other lab members recognize this or not. Sometimes this may be more apparent, if the make-up of the lab group is highly skewed. Highlighting individuals’ group membership by asking them to be ‘ambassadors’ or representatives of their group (or in some other way) can be tiresome and offensive to an individual so singled out, but ignoring diversity can be equally problematic. Keep this balance in mind as you communicate with each other and about group memberships. Please think of this both in a systemic way (e.g. would a lab where group membership was continually emphasized or ignored be a positive place to work?) and an individual way (e.g. would I want to work in a lab where people seemed to focus on only X about me to the general exclusion of everything else? Or, where people ignored X about me, despite my making its centrality in my life clear?). Even if an individual is not offended, please do not unfairly place a burden on someone by asking them to represent a group and/or correct your problematic behavior. Please try to avoid making broad assumptions about various group memberships (e.g. women are so A, men are so B). Also, consider whether some terms (e.g. ‘guys’) are really (gender- etc.) neutral and consider alternatives (e.g. folks).\nSome group memberships can be less visible or invisible until they become apparent for various reasons (e.g. sexual orientation, religious affiliation, ethnicity, disability, socioeconomic status). Try to avoid making assumptions about individuals, and help ensure that the lab is a positive place for diverse folks. This will make the lab a better place to work, but is also required by the law.\nIf someone makes a comment you find offensive (whether it is a comment directed to you or your group membership, or someone else’s), please make your best effort to work from the assumption that there may be a misunderstanding and that communication is the best way to clear this up. Document the situation by making a note of it somewhere. Approach the person immediately or within the week to let them know (a) what they said, (b) it offended you, (c) why you found it offensive, and potentially (d) what they might say instead. Language norms change over time and from place to place, so individuals might not be aware of what is currently considered offensive and what is currently considered appropriate and respectful. If concerns remain and/or the situation is serious, please bring it to Jeff’s attention as soon as possible. Jeff would like to promote a lab environment where folks feel comfortable to communicate respectfully.",

    "text": "2.2 Lab culture\nWe aim to have a healthy research culture for all lab members. To this end, we follow the “Ten simple rules towards healthier research labs” (Maestre 2019) and add a few more.\n\nPromote the well-being of lab members: One of the lab priorities is the safety, security, and well-being of lab personnel. We care about you and wish you to be successful. We expect all lab members to be kind and avoid harassment and discrimination. We are sensitive to dealing with lab members’ personal, family, and health situations, and we carefully listen to lab members regarding any matter related to their work that can improve their well-being. Lab members don’t have to provide details, but please let Jeff or a grad student know if you need time away from the lab.\nFoster diversity and inclusion: One of the lab priorities is to maintain an inclusive working environment that respects diverse perspectives; seeks empathic understanding of diverse experiences, including discrimination, bias, and privilege; and fosters opportunities for underrepresented students to participate in science (See Diversity and inclusion). We do not discriminate based on sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, ethnicity, disability, socioeconomic status, first generation status. We encourage individuals from underrepresented groups to join and participate in the lab.\nEnsure transparent data and replicable analsyses: One of the lab priorities is to maintain the integrity and transparency of data and the replicability of data analyses (see Reproducible research and open science). We maintain a transparent project workflow from data collection analysis. We share all data, materials, and code upon posting a preprint or publishing a paper, whenever possible. We rely on open access software as much as possible (see Software).\nLet people set their own schedules: Jeff tends to work in his office (or home office) from 8am-5:30pm Monday-Friday and as needed in the evenings and weekends. Other lab members, however, may have different preferences for working hours. Everyone is expected to fulfill their full weekly work time and is welcome to set their own work schedule within the constraints of their tasks (e.g., running human participants or animal subjects at appointed times). However, if your hours differ greatly from the standard 8am-5pm work day, consider how to be trade off work on collaborative projects to avoid losing days of work. Lab members can work remotely when this is appropriate for their project.\nGratitude: This lab could not function without the help from all of the students and staff. Jeff is extremely grateful for all of the hard work that lab members pour into the lab. If you do not feel like your role is appreciated, please contact him to discuss this. Because you definitely are appreciated!\nTreat your lab members as teammates: Jeff is the PI for the lab, so he sets the vision and research priorities for the lab and has the last say on multiple matters in the lab. But the aim is to have a relatively ‘flat hierarchy’ where all lab members are treated as valued colleagues. All lab members’ opinions and contributions are important, and Jeff would very much like to hear your suggestions for how to improve any aspect of the lab and research (though please do not make changes with out getting permission!).\nCreate a collaborative environment: Doing science is a collective endeavor, and we actively foster collaborations within the labs. We do this by requiring attendance of lab meetings where we get updates and feedback on research projects. If you have ideas for projects, please discuss them with Jeff and/or grad students in the lab. We expressly build a collaborative rather than a competitive research environment.\nEvery lab member is unique: While comparisons are inevitable, each lab member brings unique skills, ideas, and experiences to the lab. What a boring lab it would be if everyone were the same! When you interview with Jeff before joining the lab, he will ask about career goals. This is to help tailor your lab experience to your aspirations. If those change or if you see ways that the lab can facilitate your personal goals, talk with Jeff and/or grad students. We want to leverage everyone’s unique contributions and focus them toward helping achieve their goals.\nRespect working hours, public holidays, and vacations: While some lab members may choose to work on evenings, weekends, and holidays, typically this is not expected unless there are extenuating circumstances (e.g., urgent deadline, public outreach event). Lab members are encouraged to take vacations. Undergraduate assistants are not expected to work over fall break, winter break, spring break, or summer break, but they can if they would like. Grad students are encouraged to take vacation time during winter and summer break (1-2 weeks), depending on on their funding and research situation. Other vacation times are allowed, too. The important thing is to make sure to notify Jeff and/or grad students in advance of when you will be away.\nGive credit where credit is due: We try to be clear about authorship by deciding on who will be an author early in the research project (see Authorship). Undergraduate assistants and lab technicians can be authors when they materially contribute to the project. Jeff will not be on papers that he does not materially contribute to. Papers and presentations should acknowledge the assistance of lab members who help with projects.\nDestigmatize failure and celebrate success: Projects fail and papers, grant applications, and job applications are rejected. A lot. Rejections are the rule rather than the exception. We will all struggle scientifically—this is not a reflection on us as people. We must learn from rejection and use that to improve our science. We must also celebrate our successes—not just our big successes, like paper acceptances, grants, and jobs, but also smaller successes like submitting a paper and giving a presentation. The road to good science is paved with a lot of small accomplishments, each of which should be celebrated!\nPromote the professional development of your lab members: Members of the lab come from a range of backgrounds and have a range of career goals. We want to help develop you to meet your professional goals. We will try to assign you to projects that helps you toward your goals, and we will try to offer professional development opportunities during lab meetings and other times. Undergraduate assistants can help design and implement studies, as well as analyze and present data. Grad students can gain experience mentoring undergraduate assistants. We financially possible, we will help send students to conferences to present their work. Contact Jeff if you see opportunities to achieve your career goals.\nExpress your curiosity and critical thinking: Science is driven by curiosity. We recruit curious people to the lab because we want to answer questions, and curiosity is needed to reveal potential answers to those questions. So we encourage lab members to ask questions, propose ideas, suggest changes, question the status quo of what we are doing. Be bold. Speak up. Challenge us intellectually. Think about things from another perspective. There are no stupid questions or suggestions. We want to hear your ideas. We may not be able to act on them, but we want to hear them. Your voice will be heard.",

    "section": "2.3 Communication",
    "text": "2.3 Communication\nThe key to a healthy lab is communication. So please don’t ever feel afraid to reach out to Jeff or any lab members. We would rather you reach out too often than not enough. Here’s how we communicate in the lab:\n\n2.3.1 Microsoft Teams\nThe primary means of communication among lab members is the lab Microsoft Teams workspace. Upon entering the lab everyone should install Teams on their phones and computers. Turn on the notification settings for the channels that you’re a part of, and also please regularly check Teams and reply there when needed.\nTeams is divided into channels that have different members in them. Some of these channels are project specific, and others are just a group of specific individuals (e.g., grad students). Most of the channels are open, so you are welcome to join them to observe or participate in what is going on. Here is some Teams etiquette.\n\nUse Teams as a positive forum. Do not post potentially offensive material.\nImportant messages can be pinned so that they are saved.\nYou can use bullet points (to combine posts) by starting a line with * and a space then hit Enter to start a new line without posting the message.\nYou can attach multiple files to one message rather than sending separate messages.\nYou can direct message lab members. Jeff cannot view these messages. However, this software is run by UNL, therefore the ITS folks have access to everything that we post in Teams. So assume your post is being monitored.\nMessages in public/shared channels can be viewed by people who join the channel after the messages are posted.\nDon’t post to the General channel unless it needs to go to everyone in all of the labs (this should rarely be used by anyone but Jeff).\nFeel free to use the random channel to post (appropriate) jokes or other random things.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Communication types and timing\nOutside of Teams, email is Jeff’s preferred mode of communication. Feel free to prompt him via email if he doesn’t respond via Teams after a day (sometimes Teams doesn’t send notifications properly, or he reads the notification when he is not able to respond and then forgets about it). If something is urgent or difficult to communicate over Teams or email, feel free to call Jeff. Text is the least preferred method of communicating with Jeff.\n\n\n2.3.3 Meetings\nUsually, Jeff meets with grad students weekly to keep up-to-date with projects and to offer a regular opportunity to get feedback. If you would like to meet at other times, just contact Jeff over Teams to see when he is available. When meeting, it is often useful to give a quick recap of the project before discussing issues/questions that you have. There are a lot of different projects going on in the lab, and it can be difficult to remember exactly what is going on with each one. It is often useful for the student to take notes during the meeting to ensure that everything is accounted for.\n\n\n2.3.4 Problems\nOpen communication is the key to preventing or resolving problems in the lab. If you are having problems with other students or lab equipment/materials, contact Jeff or a grad student. If you are having problems with a grad student, contact Jeff. If you are having a problem with Jeff, contact Jeff. If you’re not comfortable contacting Jeff, you can contact other faculty (Mike Dodd and Maital Neta have agreed to be available for lab members to contact), the Department Chair (David DiLillo), or the Graduate Committee Chair (Mike Dodd). If these parties cannot resolve the issue, a formal grievance can be submitted to the Department Chair or directly to a member of the department Grievance Committee (see instructions in Department Bylaws). For sexual harassment or misconduct issues, contact the UNL Title IX Office.\n\n\n\n\nMaestre, Fernando T. 2019. “Ten Simple Rules Towards Healthier Research Labs.” PLOS Computational Biology 15 (4): e1006914. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006914.",

If you’re using lab equipment, put it away when you’re done.\nClose/lock the doors to the lab if no one else is around, even if you’re stepping out for a short break (e.g., to get coffee).\nArrive to lab at least 15 minutes before you have any human subject experiments scheduled, so that you will be there to greet the participants.\nShow up to all meetings, show up to run your participants, show up for any other commitments (classes, lab meetings).\nYou are expected to meet any and all deadlines set by Jeff (or agreed upon among collaborators). If you are going to miss a deadline, you must give advance notice along with a reason and a proposed new deadline that must be agreed upon by all parties.\n\nIf you are hoping to submit an abstract to a conference, you must inform the members of the project team (including Jeff) no less than 2 weeks prior to the abstract deadline, and you must complete a draft of the abstract no less than 1 week prior to the deadline.\nFor posters, a draft must be completed two weeks prior to the conference in order to facilitate feedback from the team (first) and then the wider group (lab and other colleagues in the department/CB3).\n\nIf you’re sick, stay home and rest. Because you need it and because others don’t need to get sick. Notify your supervisor if you will be out, either due to illness or vacation. If you are sick and you had experiments or meetings scheduled that day, notify your participants or collaborators and reschedule.\nYou are not expected to come into lab on staff holidays. If you are being paid, then you are expected to come into lab during university breaks (except for staff holidays or if you’re taking your paid vacation time).\nThe dress code in academia is generally casual. My only request is that you look semi-professional when interacting with participants and when presenting your work. Jeans are fine, gym clothes and pajamas are not. Scrubs are available for you to use.\nPersonal protective equipment (PPE) is currently a moving target. Follow Jeff’s guidelines on whether masks and gloves are required in the lab.\nFood and drink are allowed in the dog lab, but please keep them in the office or food-preparation area and clean up any spills.\nWell-behaved dogs are allowed in the dog lab and the CB3 bullpen when they need to be on campus for research or educational purposes (e.g., human-animal interaction study, training for HAI study, dog destressing event, outreach activities, guest lectures). Dogs are not allowed in university buildings (including CB3) if they do not fall under one of Jeff’s IACUC protocols. Check with Jeff before bringing your dog into a university building. Note that it is super important not to jeopardize the lab’s ability to bring dogs into campus buildings for research and educational purposes. Therefore, to protect this ability, Jeff will report violations of the campus animal policy.\nWe have shared-use lockers in B71 and in the B-level bullpen for secure research materials (e.g., signed consent forms, equipment, participant payment). Contact Jeff to get access to those lockers.",

Anyone without a UNL parking permit will need to park in the metered parking south of Memorial Stadium or the Memorial Drive parking garage on the southwest corner of the stadium. Enter the doors with the NCB3 sign above it, and proceed to the reception. Upon entering CB3, you can ask Linda at the reception to give you directions to Jeff’s office or, if she is not available, take the elevator (just around the corner from her desk) to level B (press BR on the panel to open the doors closest to his office).\nJeff’s office is B83 East Stadium, and grad students have desks in the bullpen on level B down the hall. We currently have exclusive access to  B71J and shared access to other rooms in B71 for human computer-based testing. There is also meeting space on the B and C levels that can be scheduled through Linda Lynch (contact at linda.lynch@unl.edu). CB3 is open from 7:45am-5pm Monday-Friday. If you need access to the building outside of those hours, contact Jeff.\n\n\n4.2.2 Canine Cognition Lab\nThe Canine Cognition and Human Interaction Lab (CCHIL) is located in room 3 in the basement of the 501 Building. You can pay to park in the Memorial Drive parking garage on the southwest corner of the stadium. CCHIL is in the northeast corner of the 501 Building in the basement. Keycard access is required at all times to enter CCHIL. Contact Jeff for keycard access.\nCCHIL has a waiting area, testing area, office space, and food-preparation area. If no one is using the space for research or educational purposes, you are welcome to hang out or work there. But please keep the space orderly and be prepared to vacate it if the space is needed for other purposes.\n\n\n4.2.3 Keycard access\nTo gain access to most of our space, you need permission granted to your NUID (keycard). Only Jeff can request this permission, and it can take a few days to go through, so contact him as soon as possible if you need access. And always bring your NUID with you when you are coming into the lab. It is possible to call the police to let you in to space that you should have access to, but this is not advised. And don’t leave your NUID in the research space. Keep it with you at all times. Finally, do not let someone that you do not know into any of the research spaces. If you are uncomfortable with the situation call the UNL police (402-472-2222) and report the incident to Jeff or a grad student.\n\n\n4.2.4 Visitors and photos\nVisitors are allowed in CB3 during regular business hours. If you would like to bring visitors to CB3 outside of regular hours or to CCHIL, contact Jeff.\nDo not take photos of participants or dogs without their explicit permission. For CCHIL, participants must sign a media release for us to take and use photos of them and/or their dogs for research, educational, or promotional reasons. Contact Jeff or the CCHIL lab manager for media release forms.",

Students are allowed to use these computers for research or educational purposes, with priority given to people who need them for research purposes. The lab also has external hard drives for backing up data.\n\n\n4.5.2 Software\nThe lab works with two computer operating systems. Most computers run Windows 10/11 but some also run the latest long-term support version of Ubuntu (some computers run both operating systems). It is important to keep operating systems and applications up-to-date, so please facilitate this. Do not install applications on lab computers without Jeff’s approval.\n\nCloud storage\nCurrently, most of the lab’s data is stored or backed up on Microsoft OneDrive. In general, all raw data should be uploaded to cloud storage as soon as it is generated. See Data management for more details.\n\n\nFile management and version control\nWe use GitHub as for file management and version control. See Data management and Version control for more details.\n\n\nExperimental data collection\nWe use Qualtrics as our web-based survey software. Contact Jeff for log in details to the lab account. For more complicated designs that cannot be implemented in Qualtrics, we use PsychoPy or OpenSesame, which are open source programs for creating experiments.\n\n\nData analysis\nThe lab primarily uses R Statistical Software to analyze data, using RStudio as a user interface. Undergrads may also use JASP for a GUI-driven stats package. We do not use SPSS, SAS, Stata, etc.\n\n\nCommunication\nThe lab uses Microsoft Teams for all lab communication. See Teams for more details.\n\n\nLiterature and bibliographies\nTo keep track of literature and to build bibliographies for papers, the lab uses Zotero. Better BibTeX is a useful plug-in that helps integrate Zotero with R Markdown documents.\n\n\nOther\nWe use other open source software as well:\n\nGIMP—image editing (free version of Adobe Photoshop)\nInkscape—scalar vector graphics editing (free version of Adobe Illustrator)\nVLC—media player\nOpenShot—video editing\n\n\n\n\n4.5.3 Passwords\nPlease do not send passwords over email or Slack/Teams.

(Click on the section to expand and edit)\n\n\nUse this section to name the event, set a location, give a brief description, set the url for the event, and choose the display color. The event name is what the participants see, so make it understandable for them but also signals to us what the project is (in case more than one project runs at a time). The location should be In-person meeting and enter 501 Building, room 3. Give a short description to remind the participants what the appointment is. The event link is the URL that will direct people to the booking page for this event. The URL will automatically start with calendly.com/cchil-unl/ so you are just picking an identifier for this specific study to put at the end of the URL.\n\n\nWhen can people book this event?\n\n\nUse this section to set the time slots available.\nThe template event defaults to showing owners times they can book up to 21 days in the future.\nIf the study will only be running for a set amount of time or availability will need to be manually updated on a weekly/monthly basis, use the Within a date range option under Date range and select the dates study date range.\nUnder Duration you select how long the study session will last (often 1 hour).\nTo set times I usually use the Set custom hours option.\n\nThen select which days you want to be available and fill out the time table based on when enough RAs are available.\nIf you need multiple time ranges on one day you can use the + symbol to add another range (e.g., 9:00-11:00 am and 1:00-3:00 pm).\nAll availability is automatically recurring on a weekly basis unless otherwise stated.\nTo change availability on individual days (non-recurring changes), click on the Add a date override button to the right. Then select on the day you want to customize the times for.\n\nIf there is a certain day you want no availability, but you don’t want all those days unavailable (e.g., you want Wednesday, Jan. 4 to be available but not Wednesday, Jan 11), then click on Add a date override, select the date, and then hit the trash can symbol.\n\nThis will make that day unavailable without altering the rest of the weeks.\n\nAt the bottom of this section you can select to add time before or after your events.\n\nAdd 15 minutes before the event to prepare the room.\nAdd 30 minutes after the event to give us time to clean/reset before the next dog.\nCalendly will automatically remove the affected time slots to give you this extra time.\n\nUnder Additional rules for your availability\n\nYou can select what increments you want your sessions to be posted in (30 minutes is probably best).\nYou can also alter the scheduling conditions to set a limit to how soon before the appointment they can schedule as well as the maximum allowed events per day. We usually set it so they cannot schedule within 1 or 2 days of the appointment to give time to send all the confirmation emails and make sure all RAs were informed.\n\n\n\nInvitee Questions\n\n\nCalendly automatically asks for their Name, Email, and if there is anything they want to share\nThe template event also includes a “What is your dog’s name?” question that is set as required. This helps make sure the owner was bringing in the correct dog in the instances where an owner has multiple dogs.\nUnder this section, you can also add other questions to ask. Some studies may want to ask for additional information from the owner in this section. \n\n\n\n5.1.3 Finding participants in the database\n\nThe CCHIL participant database has personally identifiable information (names, email addresses). Therefore, you can only access the database on UNL-owned computers. For most purposes, this means the desktop computer in the dog lab. Do not access the database from your personal computer.\nLog into the Dog Lab dashboard with the username and password that Jeff gave you and click the option Continue to run a report or search.\nClick on the “All Eligible Dogs (+ Owner Contact)” and save the spreadsheet file on the C drive of the computer.\nOpen the spreadsheet file in Excel and save it as an .xlsx file. This allows you to sort, filter, and color code the file.\nOnce you have sorted and filtered down to the correct records, check eligibility status by confirming:\n\n\nThe dog is not aggressive towards people.\nThe rabies vaccination is up to date (given within 3 years of appointment date).\nAny other requirements (e.g., weight minimum).\n\n\nOnce the dog’s eligibility is confirmed, the owner may be sent an invitation email (see Sending email invitations).\nIf you want to search for a particular owner or dog, type the owner’s last name into the search bar at the bottom of the dashboard page.\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Sending email invitations\n\nPick out the participants from the spreadsheet that you want to contact. A good rule of thumb is selecting twice as many participants as you have open slots in the calendar.\nAccess the CCHIL UNL shared email account (unl_cchil@unl.edu) delegated to you by Jeff (instructions for accessing shared accounts in Outlook).\nCompose a new email and click on the three horizontal dots, then click My Templates, and select the appropriate template for this study email.\nIt works best to send a separate email to each participant so that you can specify which dog is invited. This is especially important for studies with requirements like minimum weights.\nOnce the invitation email is sent, the participants can select a time in the Calendly calendar that works for them. When they book an appointment, Calendly will send an email to the UNL CCHIL email account, so keep an eye on that account.\nAfter an appointment has been made in Calendly, send a Teams notification to the lab assistants assigned to the session to notify them of the new appointment. You can also then send a confirmation email to the participant with any additional information they will need.\nIt is useful to send reminder emails to participants at the beginning of the week.\nThe UNL CCHIL account also has templates for registering new people into the database and asking them to update their vaccination records.",

    "text": "6.1.1 Project directory structure\nThe lab uses a consistent project management style to facilitate collaboration across members and to facilitate the open dissemination of our work. To participate in data analysis or manuscript preparation, you will need to organize the files on your local computer with a particular structure to match the lab’s structure. If you do not have one already, you should create a projects or research or CCHIL work directory on your computer. We highly recommend creating this directory with your Microsoft OneDrive folder on your computer.\nOnce you have an overall projects directory in place, you can create a subdirectory for the current project. Within the project directory, you will want to use the following subdirectory structure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadmin This is the administrative directory that should contain information about IRB protocols, IACUC protocols, pre-registration documents, experimental protocols, and other files associated with the logistics of the project. It also has a file called project_log.md that is a log of the event associated with the project.\ncode This is the directory for the computer code that is used to collect data. For example, there might be Python, PsychoPy, or OpenSesame code here. Not all projects have a code directory.\ndata This is the directory that stores the project data. Often there is a subdirectory called raw_data for raw data.\ndocs This is the document directory that stores the files for manuscripts and presentations (posters and talks). This is where most Rmd files go. We do not place administrative documents here—only documents for disseminating our results.\nfigures This is the directory for hand-drawn and script-generated figures.\nR This is the directory that contains the data analysis scripts. In general, there should be a data processing script and a data analysis script.\nCITATION.md This file gives the citation for the published version of the project (e.g., journal citation).\nLICENSE.md This file describes the license under which the project is published (e.g., Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License).\nREADME.md This file give a short overview of the project and is the landing page for the project on GitHub.\n\nIn general, use subdirectories to organize the main directories and limit the files in the main directories to just the core files. We will often create old subdirectories to move old or irrelevant files into.\n\n\n6.1.2 Existing projects\nMost projects in the lab already have project directories, and they are available to collaborators in the lab. These directories are available as Git repositories (repos) at GitHub, a website that stores, backs up, and version controls code. Git is a very powerful tool for tracking changes that happen to files, and GitHub is a great way to facilitate online collaboration. Briefly, GitHub allows you to clone (install new) existing repos from the remote GitHub source to your local computer, pull changes from a remote repo to update your local repo, and push changes you make locally up to the remote repo. Check out Github’s glossary for more definitions. To learn more about working with Git, check out the Version control section.\nSo if you want access to the project directories, you need to create a GitHub account and send Jeff your GitHub account name. Once you’re added to the lab team as a contributor, you can clone the repo locally to your own computer and start working on the files.\nNote that GitHub does not automatically sync your computer with the remote repo. This is done for two reasons: (1) multiple people can be working on a file at a time, which can cause conflicts and (2) project manager may want control over what changes are accepted and rejected. Therefore, you must manually pull changes from the remote repo that other people have pushed there. Please always pull from the remote repo everytime before you start working on a project. Also, when you make changes to files on your local repo, you must manually push them to the remote repo. In some cases, your pushes will be automatically accepted. But in other cases, your pushes must be reviewed by the repo maintainer to make sure that they are acceptable.\n\n\n6.1.3 RStudio Projects\nBecause most of our analyses and documents are done in RStudio, we use RStudio Projects for our projects. Creating an RStudio Project sets the working directory in RStudio to the project’s root directory. This is useful because when you open an RStudio Project, you always know what working directory you are using. Combined with the functionality of the here() function of the {here} package, you will not have to spend any time worried about setting directories with an RStudio Project.\nRStudio Projects also will automatically open the documents that were opened last time that you used the Project. Finally, you must work in an RStudio Project to be able to use version control via Git in RStudio.\nSo you should create an RStudio Project for every project that you will be using RStudio for. To open the RStudio Project, double click on the .Rproj file in your project root directory (do not open RStudio through the app menu).",

    "section": "6.2 Project workflow",
    "text": "6.2 Project workflow\nThe way in which we manage our project workflow can (1) maintain consistency and facilitate collaboration across the lab, (2) ensure more robust scientific practices, and (3) encourage open science and facilitate publishing our work in a reproducible way. Therefore, the lab uses consistent tools and steps to maintain a reproducible project workflow. In general, our lab\n\npre-registers our studies,\ncollects data in an open manner (using open-source software when possible),\narchives raw data without alteration,\nuses R to process that raw data,\ngenerates ‘working data sets’,\nuses R to analyze working data to calculate descriptive statistics, conduct statistical tests, and generate figures,\nuses R Markdown to produce manuscripts and presentations to disseminate our work,\nposts our data collection materials, working data sets, R analysis scripts, and R Markdown documents with our published articles.\n\nThis workflow needs to be in place for all CCHIL lab members. However, the workflow is not immutable—if you have suggestions on ways to improve it, let Jeff know. Though imposing our structure on collaborators is not feasible, we will try to maintain our project workflow as much as possible with people outside of the lab.\n\n6.2.1 Pre-registration\nOne way to improve replicability of our studies is to pre-register them (Nosek et al. 2019). Pre-registration means that you write down and post your plan for methods, data collection, data processing, and analysis before starting data collection. Pre-registration forces you to think about how you will analyze your data before you have any. This both helps in designing your data collection tools and limits the degrees of freedom available for p-hacking at the analysis step.\nThere are a number of different ways to pre-register a study. This simplest is to complete the nine-question form at AsPredicted.org. Alternatively, the Open Science Framework pre-registration system provides a more thorough avenue to pre-register your study. I highly recommend using the {prereg} package to create your pre-registration in R Markdown before submitting. However you choose to do so, you will need to pre-register your studies before starting data collection.\n\n\n6.2.2 Data collection\nWhen designing data collection tools (e.g., Qualtrics surveys, PsychoPy scripts, etc.), it is important to think about how the data will be used downstream in the work flow. So before designing data collection, make sure to understand the rest of the workflow and think carefully about how the information you collect will be used in the workflow. Take the time to carefully design these tools to facilitate easier data analysis.\n\nStandard practices for data files\n\nOrganize data files logically and separate them into subdirectories if appropriate.\nSave data files as csv (comma-separated value) files. In general, use plain text files (txt, md) as much as possible. Avoid using Excel and Word files when possible.\nName files consistently. In general, ‘snake_case’ (that is, lower case with an underscore between words: response_time) works best. Avoid uppercase letters and spaces in file names. If possible, use a script to automatically name files consistently. If appending a date, use proper ISO standard dates: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., my_file-2020-05-22.csv)\nWithin data files, use descriptive variable names written in snake_case. Abbreviations are acceptable, but make sure that they are readable and understandable. Do not use upper case letters or spaces in variable names.\nThink carefully about how the data values should be labeled, considering how you will be working with those values in R. For instance, avoid using spaces in value labels (use snake_case when possible). For example, do you want to use words (e.g., Yes/No, LL/SS) which are more descriptive or numbers (e.g., 1/0) which can be used to calculate proportions directly?\nUse the proper ISO standard for dates and times: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss (e.g., 2020-05-20 09:48:00) or just YYYY-MM-DD for dates.\nAvoid collecting identifiable data when possible. And ensure that you are only collecting data that you have IRB permission to collect. For instance, in Qualtrics, unless you requested permission to do so, you must disable the recording of particpant IP address (Survey Options &gt; Security &gt; Anonymize Response).\n\n\n\nData security\nIn addition to attending to the structure of data collection, take the time to ensure data security.\n\nOnly store data files on password-protected computers. If you must use shared computers, transfer the data files to OneDrive, double check that they are all uploaded to OneDrive, delete them from the shared computer, and empty them from the trash. You cannot store data with personally identifiable information on personal computers. They can only be stored on lab computers.\nDo not leave publicly accessible computers unlocked. For example, if you are working in the B71 bullpen or the library or a coffee shop, do not leave your computer unattended and unlocked. Lock your screen.\nDo not share any lab passwords outside the lab, and do not leave passwords visible to others.\nDo not upload data (especially participant-related information) to any cloud storage systems besides OneDrive (e.g., not Google Drive). We only have permission to store data in OneDrive.\nDo not make or use public GitHub repos until all data analyses are public, and the PI has authorized making the repo public.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Raw data\nAll raw data should either be automatically saved to a cloud storage service or should be moved there as soon as possible. Currently, the lab uses OneDrive to store all raw data, and each project should have its own OneDrive folder that is shared with all of the project members. Note that OneDrive raw data folders do not necessarily have to be synced onto your local computer.\nNote that we are using OneDrive as an archive for all raw data. That means that all raw data need to be archived on OneDrive, even if it is a ‘bad’ data file (e.g., incomplete data, interrupted session, wrong subject/date entered, etc.). If necessary, a subdirectory for ‘bad’ data can be created and these files can be moved there. But every data file created must be archived on OneDrive.\nBecause this is an archive of the data, we do not EVER alter the raw data files, including the file names. Any changes that need to be made to data must happen downstream in the R scripts. Raw data should never be changed. If changes need to be made, they need to be entered into the project_log.md file and a separate notes file (if desired).\nOneDrive files are versioned (meaning it saves previous versions) and authored (meaning we can see who made changes). So we can revert to previous versions, but this should not need to happen. Do not change raw data files.\n\n\n6.2.4 Data processing\nIn the lab, all data processing occurs transparently via R. Never change any data files in Excel. While Excel saves the changes that you make to files, it does not save the process of that change. Our lab prioritizes making the entire data analysis workflow transparent, and Excel does not allow transparency, so it is not allowed to be a part of our workflow.\nTo achieve this, we usually have a single R script called something like data_processing.R. This script inputs the raw data and processes it to generate the working data set that will be published with the article.\n\nFix some of the problems with data files that occurred at data collection (e.g., fix wrong subject number/date).\nCombine separate subject-specific files into single data set.\nRemove unnecessary columns and rename and reorder existing columns.\nRecode data values.\nConvert dates into ISO if not recorded that way.\nPivot data into tidy format (if that is appropriate).\nMerge different data files into single file.\n\nNote the only aim of this script is to generate a publication-ready working data set. There should be no analysis conducted in this script. Every statistic in the manuscript should come from the analysis script. While the data processing script does need to be commented and documented, it does not need to be as polished as the analysis script.\n\n\n6.2.5 Working data\nThe working data set is the data file (or files) that will be posted with the published article. As such, it needs to be clean and polished. Ideally, there is only a single working data set, so try to merge different data sets together in the data processing script. If that is not possible, multiple working data sets are acceptable, but try to minimize the number of working data sets.\nCharacteristics of working data sets:\n\nThese files should only include the columns that are relevant to the subsequent data analysis.\nInclude dates and times when possible.\nMake sure that the column names are both human and R readable—meaning they are understandable to people but are easy for R to work with (e.g., snake_case).\n\n\n\n6.2.6 Data analysis\nThere should be a single data analysis script for one article manuscript (that will be published with that manuscript). If multiple scripts were created during data analysis, they should be combined into a single script. It should contain the code for all of the analyses in the manuscript. If there are analyses that cannot be run in R, this should be made clear in the manuscript. It should not contain code that is not contained or referenced in the manuscript. Save unused analyses in other scripts.\nIn general, the analysis script should use the tidyverse system of working with, analyzing, and plotting data. The data analysis script should contain the following in this order:\n\nA header that includes the name of the script, the purpose of the script, the author(s) of the script, the date that the script was started, the date of the current version of the script, the license under which the script is published, notes on how to run the script, a list of data files, and a description of all of the columns in the data files.\nA list of packages to load at the very beginning of the script. In general, it is recommended to order the scripts alphabetically unless function masking necessitates another order (e.g., {here} should go last and {tidyverse} second to last). For packages with a single use or only a few uses, include this in a comment after loading the package. Minimize the number of packages loaded for your script.\nA list of custom-coded functions needed for your analysis. Name your function using tidyverse style: “Ideally, the name of your function will be short, but clearly evoke what the function does. … Generally, function names should be verbs, and arguments should be nouns.”\nImport the working data file. If you are using an RStudio project (which you should be!), the {here} package is useful for setting working directories properly in RStudio. Use the here function when setting the path to import your data.\nCalculate descriptive statistics of participants/subjects, such as age, gender/sex, and other demographic variables. For human participant studies, this should generate a demographic information table for the supplementary materials.\nCalculate inferential statistics. Typically, we calculate and report frequentist statistics, Bayes factors, and effect sizes. We also report the key means \\(\\pm\\) 95% confidence intervals (either between- or within-subjects) and place the model assumption checks here.\nPlots can either be carved out as a separate section or integrated in with the inferential statistics. Having a separate section is often nice because someone can run the rest of the script without saving new plots, which changes the files and requires them to be staged and updated in the Git commit. Use {ggplot2} or ggplot extension packages to make plots when possible.\nCreate a separate section at the end for supplemental tables and figures.\n\n\nHigh-computation analyses\nSometimes, our analyses can require extensive computations that can take a long time to run. While working through the data analysis, I will often have these scripts write their output to a data file. Then I will comment out the high-computation code and simply import the data file. This will greatly speed up the sourcing of the full R script.\nFor the final version of the script, however, you will need to uncomment the code and remove the write and read commands. I usually add a comment before the high-computation code warning the user that the code will take a while to process.",

    "text": "6.3 Reproducible research and open science\nThe lab’s policy is to generate reproducible research—that is, we provide the experimental code, working data, R analysis script, and manuscript file used to generate the final document. This allows other researchers to rerun our studies, rerun our code, or reanalyze our data. While it can be scary to put our work out there for public scrutiny, this is what science is about. It can be uncomfortable to have others scrutinize our work. But the benefits of having someone detect an error and correcting the scientific record is more important than our individual egos. We need to be comfortable saying that we were wrong.\n\n6.3.1 Coding\nWe should write our code assuming that someone else will be reading it. This is guaranteed to happen when future you revisits the code after taking a break. But we should also assume that a different person will be looking at the code.\n\nCoding principles\n\nWrite the code as concisely and simply as possible.\nBreak your code into logical sections. RStudio allows you to create sections in R scripts with ctrl+shift+R.\nUse functions to automate repetitive tasks. As {tidyverse} author Hadley Wickham recommends, you should write a function if you have to do something three or more times (Wickham and Grolemund 2017).\nUse comments a lot and comment as you are writing the code. Don’t wait to comment afterwards. I tend to use comments as subsections to describe conceptually what a block of code does as well as after almost every line to specify the function of that line.\nUse version control to maintain updates of code.\n\nHere are some R-specific coding principles:\n\nUse &lt;- as assignment operator.\nUse short but descriptive variable names.\nIn variable names, separate words with _ or . (e.g., my_vector).\nDon’t use functions as variable names (e.g., c, mean).\nUse blank space between all objects, operators (*, =, ==), and after all commas\nWrite out TRUE and FALSE.\nUse indents to separate nested components. Highlighting text and pressing ctrl+I will automatically indent code properly.\n\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Documentation\nIn addition to commenting code, documentation is important to maintaining reproducible research.\nFirst, creating and updating a project log is important. The project_log.md file in a project’s admin folder is the best place to start for this (here’s an example project log). The log simply comprises a date and a description of the what happened in the project that day. Entries for these logs can include IRB/IACUC approval dates and protocol numbers, experiment start/pause/stop dates, experiment assistant start/stop dates, anomalous data descriptions (e.g., “program stopped while subject was running, so I restarted it and labelled it subject 102b”). While it may seem tedious, and you may forget to add entries, updating the project log is critical to keep track of issues that may be relevant to data analysis and interpretation, especially months or years after the issues occurred. The project log should be used from the inception of the project, through data collection, data analysis, and manuscript preparation. It can be closed upon final publication.\nSecond, README files are important for documenting the structure and process of a study project. There is a README.md in the root directory of every project. This file should include the project name and overview, a list of specific aims and research questions, and a project protocol describing the structure of the project and the expectations for working on the project. This should be updated to include the citation and abstract of the accepted manuscript when the project is published. This file is what shows up on the main page of the GitHub repo for the project.\nOnce a project is ready for submission, there should also be a README.md file added to the reproducible research folder. This file should include the author(s) and creation date of the file, a request for a citation of the manuscript, the license under which the script is published, notes on how to compile the file/run the script, a short summary of the data and data processing, a list of data files, a description of all of the columns in the data files, a list of R scripts.\n\n\n6.3.3 R Markdown/Quarto\nThough it is the worldwide standard and it has some advantages such as track changes, Microsoft Word has limitations for reproducible research because you cannot embed R code into the text to show how statistics are calculated. R Markdown allows the inclusion of R code into manuscripts and can produce beautiful documents. A key benefit of this is that, if your statistics change (because you have altered the R script), you do not have to change them by hand in the document. R Markdown will automatically update them. The standard for the lab is to use R Markdown for all publications. There may be cases in which we do not use R Markdown (e.g., working with collaborators outside of the lab), but it should be the default method for writing manuscripts. And I highly recommend using {papaja} to format APA style manuscripts.\nTo use R Markdown, you will edit a plain-text .Rmd file that uses Markdown syntax to format text and R code chunks to embed R calculations. In RStudio, you can then compile this file using the {knitr} package to generate a PDF of your document. It takes a bit of time to learn Markdown and R Markdown syntax, but the time invested is worth it to generate elegant, reproducible, updatable manuscripts. You can find example R Markdown files on the lab’s publications page and check out R Markdown: The Definitive Guide (Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018).\nQuarto is the next generation of R Markdown. While it’s great for presentation and websites, there currently isn’t a robust template for making APA-formatted journal articles, so I don’t recommend using it for manuscripts just yet.\n\n\n6.3.4 Dissemination\nTo disseminate our reproducible research, we must collect all of the relevant files in a cohesive way. Therefore, we need to create a subdirectory in the docs directory called rr or osf or dryad. Within this directory, we need to place the following:\n\nData files (.csv files)\nR scripts\nR Markdown files for manuscript and supplementary materials\nBibliography and style files used by R Markdown files\nREADME file\n\nWe usually do not start formally collecting these files until after data analysis and manuscript preparation are complete. But it is important to keep this in mind as you build and work on the project.\n\nOpen Science Framework\nOnce the reproducible research files are in place, they can easily be uploaded to an Open Science Framework (OSF) project, which provides a permanent place to archive the files. OSF projects need to include the major authors as collaborators. The lead author should write a description of the project, choose a license, and add the citation, abstract, and keywords to the project wiki. Then the following components should be added: Data and R script, Figures and tables, and Preprint. Then, upload the data file and R script to Data and R script, primary and supplementary tables and figures to Figures and tables, and the PDF and R Markdown files for the manuscript and supplementary materials to Preprints. Separating the files into different components allows us to (1) allow differential public access and (2) create separate DOIs for different parts. For example,\n\n\nFigures\nWhen you publish figures in your journal articles or books, the publisher owns the copyright to those figures and may require written permission for others or you to republish them. To avoid this, I recommend publishing the figures yourself first under a license that allows anyone to reuse the figures as long as they cite the source (e.g., Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License). One way to publish your figures is to create a component in your Open Science Framework project for figures and tables, post your figures and tables there under an appropriate licence, and create a DOI for that OSF component. Then create a citation to this component (e.g., Goh, F. W., Jungck, A. C., & Stevens, J. R. (2020). Payment method effects on tipping: Figures and tables. Open Science Framework. https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/6FMVS) and add something like the following to the end of each figure caption in your manuscript: “Figure used with permission: Goh et al., 2020; available at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/6FMVS under a CC-BY4.0 license”.\n\n\nPreprints\nThe lab strives to produce and post preprints of manuscript prior to submission to journals. Posting preprints makes your information public much sooner than waiting for journal publication. While it may seem scary to post your work before it has been peer reviewed, this allows you to get feedback early, gives you credit for work early, and makes your work open and accessible to anyone. You can (and should) update your preprints as changes are made to the manuscript. Check with a journal’s preprint policy before submitting to them. Most journals are fine with preprints (some even allow you to submit to them directly from the preprint server). But some have weird policies. Do not submit your manuscript to journals that do not allow preprints.\nFor our purposes, there are two primary preprint servers. PsyArXiv focuses on psychology-related content and is associated with the OSF. In fact, you can import files directly from your OSF projects. BioRxiv focuses on biology-related content and has direct connections to many biology journals.\n\n\n\n\nNosek, Brian A., Emorie D. Beck, Lorne Campbell, Jessica K. Flake, Tom E. Hardwicke, David T.

Create a PAT by going to Settings &gt; Developer settings &gt; Personal access tokens. Generate a new token, name it, optionally set an expiration date and limit the scope. Save the generated token in your password manager (e.g., LastPass).\nWhen you log into the GitHub website, use your GitHub password. When you are interfacing with GitHub through GitHub Desktop, Git, RStudio, etc., use the PAT.

To open a command line terminal in Windows, click Start, type cmd, and select Command Prompt. For Macs, open Spotlight, type terminal, and select Terminal. For Linux, type Ctrl-Alt-T. Next, if you’re not familiar, you need to learn about working from the command line.\n\nCreate a local repository (repo)\n\nOpen a terminal.\nChange directories to the directory in which you want to create the directory (e.g., cd projects/this_project).\nType git init. This creates a hidden directory on your computer call .git that stores all of the Git files. You have to be able to view hidden files in your operating system (Windows and MacOS) to see this folder.\n\n\n\nClone a remote (GitHub) repository locally\nTo clone a repo means to copy it from GitHub to your computer. Cloning will create a directory for you, so you don’t need to create a project-specific directory before cloning. To clone the repo, change directories to the main directory where you want the new repo to be and type:\ngit clone [insert SSH/URL info from remote repository]\n\n\nAdd a local repository to GitHub\nIf you have already created a repo locally and want to put it on GitHub, you first need to create a new, empty repo in GitHub. Then, copy the URL (either HTTPS or SSH) from GitHub and type:\ngit remote add origin [insert GitHub repo URL]\n\n\nUpdate GitHub from local repository\nAfter you’ve put your repo on GitHub, you’ll want to update it when you make changes locally. To do this, you need to push the local changes to the remote repo by typing:\ngit push -u origin main\nThe term origin refers to your local version, and the main refers to the remote branch.\n\n\nUpdate local repository from the server\nIf changes are made on the remote repo, you’ll want to download them to your local repo. For this, we pull.\ngit pull\n\n\nPreserve current state of local repository (commit)\nVersion control saves the current state of a project (or subset of files). To do this, you first need to ‘stage’ the changes, which just means select the files that you want to save. After staging, you must ‘commit’ the files to actually save the files that you’ve staged. For each commit, you should include a message that describes what that commit does.\n\nStage all changes with git add . and individual files with git add [insert path/filename].\nCommit changes with git commit -m \"[Insert message here]\".\nThere is no set rule on when/what to commit, but it is useful to commit fairly frequently, and different file changes can be added to different commits.\nCommit messages should be active declarations of what changes are in the commit. They should almost always start with a present tense imperative verb (e.g., “Add Cronbach’s alpha analysis”, “Remove redundant plots”, “Replace frequentist t-test with Bayesian t-test”). Additional details can be given if committing in RStudio or other GUIs, but command line commit messages should be short. It takes a bit of practice to learn How to Write a Good Git Commit Message.\n\n\n\nView remote URL\nTo see the remote URL for a particular repo, type:\ngit remote -v\n\n\nChange remote URL\nTo change the remote URL for a repo, type:\ngit remote set-url origin [Insert URL here]\n\n\nForce pull to overwrite local changes\nSometimes, we fall behind in pulling from the remote repo or we make local changes that we don’t want to keep. To overwrite the local changes with what is on the remote repo, type:\ngit fetch --all\ngit reset --hard origin/main\n\n\nWhen things go wrong\nWhen things go wrong, check out Oh Shit, Git!?!.",

We also make presentations and poster to disseminate our findings. Here we review some tools and tips for writing and presenting our work.\nThough Microsoft Word/PowerPoint and Google Docs/Slides can be convenient, they do not make reproducible outputs. A reproducible alternative is Markdown, which is a markup language that allows you to write plain-text in a text editor and include special syntax to control formatting. Markdown files get passed to Pandoc, which can process the syntax and convert the file to a formatted output file such as HTML, PDF, or DOCX. This contrasts with Word/PowerPoint where the formatting is shown to you in the app (What You See Is What You Get or WYSIWYG).\nA key benefit of Markdown is that you can see exactly what syntax is generating the output. This concept was pushed further with R Markdown and Quarto. These packages allow you to directly embed R (or Python, Julia, or Observable in Quarto’s case) code into the Markdown document. When processing the R Markdown or Quarto file, an additional step runs the R code and embeds the results into a Markdown file before it is passed off to Pandoc. Thus, you have a file with both Markdown syntax showing the formatting and R code showing the calculations. It’s totally reproducible!\nMarkdown syntax is pretty simple. Here are some quick examples:\nCheck out the Markdown Guide for a full reference guide on Markdown syntax.

It keeps track of authors, titles, DOI, URLs, etc. so you can search through your “collection” to find sources. Critically, it also stores PDFs of each source, so it is a great way to organize PDFs.\nHow do you get sources into Zotero? It’s easy. There are extensions for all of the major web browsers. When installed, there is a little button that, if you press it while on a source’s webpage, will automatically extract the relevant meta-information (author, year, title, publisher, DOI) from the page and save a PDF (if available). You can also import meta-information either from other bibliography software (e.g., EndNote, Mendeley) or from a file with that information formatted appropriately.\nWithin Zotero, you can create ‘collections’ or subfolders that include specific sources relevant to a particular topic. So instead of sorting through my 10,000 (!) sources, I can go straight to the dog_inhibition collection to see the relevant sources. In addition, you can share collections with other Zotero users either directly via their usernames or you can create Zotero Groups to share and collaborate on collections of sources.\n\n\nFormatting bibliographies\nAnother key feature of Zotero is that it can automatically format references to your sources. For instance, if you have a collection full of sources for a paper, you can export those references, choose a formatting style, and Zotero will create a completely formatted bibliography for you. So you don’t have to remember if APA style italicizes the volume number or uses a colon or comma after the issue number. There are thousands of style files already created for most journal styles. This is especially useful if you need to quickly change styles—it just takes selecting a different style type.\nWhat’s more, you can even use special code to enter sources directly in your document as in-text citation. When you do this and compile the document the in-text citations and the bibliography are automatically formatted to the style you choose. If you add or remove sources, the bibliography is automatically update. It’s amazing! No more typing out bibliographies. Use Zotero.",

    "text": "8.2 Writing lots and well\nBefore we get to specific types of writing, it’s important to remember that writing isn’t easy for most of us. Writing is hard. Which means that we need to write a lot (meaning often) and revise a lot (meaning much of the writing). Motivating writing can be difficult, so folks often use strategies such as scheduling a certain amount of time each day to write. Or require yourself to write a certain number of words each day. Find a good time of day that works for you, and reward yourself after writing with something that you enjoy.\nBut writing a lot isn’t enough. You also need to write well to effectively communicate. First, that means know who your audience is. Are they novices who know nothing about your topic? Or are they experts in this area? I usually assume my audience is smart people who know nothing about my work.\nThe two key things to keep in mind when writing are to write simply and write concisely. Writing simply means using simpler words that more people know.\n\nAvoid using jargon or thesaurus words.\nUse simpler words instead of utilizing more complicated ones.\nWrite short sentences. Longer sentences with lots of phrases are hard to parse. Split long sentences in two.\nImagine your grandparent is reading your text. Would they understand? If not, simplify.\nCheck your readability with readability checkers.\n\nWriting concisely means using as few words as possible to convey your meaning.\n\nAvoid unnecessary phrases that convey no real meaning. Here are two big ones that I cut out every time I see them.\n\n“In order to” can just be “To” over 90% of the time.\n“Research shows that” can also almost always be removed. Just state what the research shows!\n\nAvoid passive voice when possible. Active voice tends to use fewer words and is clearer.\nRead each sentence separately and check whether each word is necessary. Be brutal and cut anything that is not necessary to convey your meaning.",

    "text": "8.3 Journal articles\nThe primary currency of productivity in the behavioral sciences is publications, with a strong emphasis on peer-reviewed journal articles. The expectation of the lab is that most of the work that we do should be published in journals. Even if the results don’t turn out as we expect, if we don’t have methodological errors, we will aim to publish our results in journals. So the expectation is that people who take the lead in projects will write up the work in journal article form. Publishing journal articles can take months or years, so even after you leave the lab, we need your help in writing, revising, and responding to reviewer questions.\nThere are two ways that lab members’ contributions to projects are signaled in journal articles: authorship and acknowledgments. Authorship signals a substantial contribution to the project (see Authorship section). Assistants who contribute less substantially are highly valued and appreciated and included in the Acknowledgment section of the paper. If you are interested in being an author on a paper, contact Jeff early to discuss ways that you can contribute to the paper in way to merit authorship.\n\n8.3.1 Journals\nBefore the writing process gets started, it is useful to think about what potential journals we would want to submit to. We want to think about this early because it can greatly shape the scope, direction, and length of the paper (especially the Introduction and Discussion). Talk to Jeff about potential journal venues. In general, Jeff has a preference for diamond open access journals, which are journals that publish papers without charging authors to publish or readers to access. These are often society-governed journals run by academics instead of for-profit publishing companies that have higher profit margins than the major tech companies and are built on the free labor that academics provide through peer review. Other journals may be appropriate for some papers, but Jeff has a strong preference for open access options and not to publish in Elsevier journals.\nSome of our favorite diamond open access journals include:\n\nAnimal Behavior & Cognition\nComparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews\nHuman-Animal Interactions\n\n\n\n8.3.2 How to write a journal article\nHere are some tips for writing journal articles.\n\nThings to think about before writing\n\nWhy are you writing a scientific article?\nWhat will be the scope of this article?\nWho is your audience?\nWhere will you submit the article?\nWho should be a co-author, and what will be their roles?\nHow will you collaborate on writing?\n\n\n\nThe structure\nResearch articles are fairly formulaic. They do not need to be especially long to get your point across. In fact, the fewer words required to communicate your point, the better. My own view about the structure of a paper fits nicely with that of Claus Wilke, and he has some very helpful pointers for writing a paper in four easy steps. I usually write them in the order Methods, Results, Discussion, Introduction, Abstract (or switch Introduction and Discussion).\nAbstract\n\nAbstracts can be difficult to write. Write your abstract for a high-school educated person with no knowledge of your research program who will not read the rest of your paper. Hook them, so that they want to!\nSome journals and fields have specific subsections to fill out: Background, Objective/Aim, Methods, Results, Conclusions. These structured abstracts can be a useful templates even if the journal does not require it, because they generally improve readability (Hartley and Sydes 1997; Hartley 2004).\nDo not ever say “X, Y, and Z are discussed”. Write your abstract in active voice as much as possible and give your conclusions rather than just say some topic is discussed.\nFeel free to copy and paste sentences from the rest of your paper (since this is likely written last), but know that you will likely have to heavily edit them to make them accessible to your audience.\nAfter writing a draft, consider running it through a readability scorer to see how accessible it will be.\n\nIntroduction\nIntroductions should be relatively short—they do not need to be full literature reviews if you are writing an empirical paper. Quickly cover the relevant literature.\n\nFirst paragraph\n\nTry to start with a specific, catchy example that gives the reader a visual experience to remember during the rest of the paper. Check out some of our previous work for examples (e.g., Duque et al., (2020) or Goh et al., (2020)).\nNext, try to expand to explain the big picture very quickly. What is the big question that this paper addresses, and why is it important?\n\nMiddle paragraphs\n\nIn the next few paragraphs, unroll a more specific story that conceptually motivates your project and places it in the theoretical foundation of your area.\nMove from background literature to the focus of your paper.\n\nFinal paragraph or two should be about the current study\n\nDescribe your overall research question(s).\nGive a short description of your approach to answering the research questions.\nEnd with your hypotheses and/or predictions.\n\n\nMethods\n\nParticipants/subjects\n\nDescribe the source and demographics of your participants.\nDescribe when your data were collected.\nDescribe why and how many participants/subject were excluded.\nGive information on IACUC/IRB approval for the project.\n\nMaterials\n\nDescribe the materials, apparatus, location.\nOften including a diagram of the experimental set-up is useful here. This can be either an image (remember, images of animal experiments must be vetted by the IACP before being made public) or a graphic you create (e.g., preferably an SVG graphic created in Inkscape).\n\nProcedure\n\nIt is usually best to describe the full procedure in detail here. It is easier to cut extraneous details than have to go back later and remember details to add.\nThis will likely be the longest section of the Methods.\nDon’t forget to include information on training/warm-ups, etc.\n\nExperimental conditions\n\nSometimes it’s nice to have a separate section describing the experimental conditions, especially if they are detailed. But sometimes it makes sense just to move this as a subsection of Procedure.\nAgain, illustrations (either images or graphics) of experimental conditions are very helpful. I recommend adding them whenever possible.\nUse good, descriptive names for experimental conditions (such as ostensive and non-ostensive rather than treatment and control) and use them consistently through the paper\n\nData analysis\n\nCite R and the R packages that you use (this is done easily in R Markdown with the {papaja}).\nDescribe where data, code, and supplementary materials can be found (e.g., Open Science Framework)\nIf applicable, describe that the document is a reproducible document written in R Markdown.\nDescribe the statistical analyses used. I find it useful to walk through the R script and describe what happens to the data.\nIf using Bayes factors, give a short description of what they mean, the thresholds that you use, and the priors (if needed). If you are estimating them from BICs, include the formula \\(e^{(BIC_{null}-BIC_{alernative}) / 2}\\). Good citations include Wagenmakers (2007) for BFs generally and the BIC formula and Wagenmakers et al. (2018) for thresholds.\n\n\nResults\n\nEach major result/hypothesis should have its own section (or at least paragraph). Start with building the figure for the section, then write a paragraph about it.\nWithin each section, start with a reminder of what the hypothesis/aim is, followed by a very brief description of how the data were analyzed.\nThen move into describing the results, using objective descriptions of what the statistical test show. Do not draw inferences or discuss conclusions from the data. Describe it in terms of your dependent and independent variables rather than the broader concepts that you are inferring from those variables.\nIf using frequentist statistics, give the test statistic, p-value, and effect size. Describe the effects, but do not use the word significant.\nFor Bayesian hypothesis testing, give the Bayes factor, and describe the results in terms of evidence for hypotheses.\n\nDiscussion\n\nStart with a paragraph giving a quick summary of the results.\nNext, spell out the implications of each of your results (in the order presented). This is where you relate the results to your hypotheses, connect them to previous literature, and give conclusions about what they mean and why they are important.\nIt is important to include limitations of your study. But don’t go overboard here, and don’t waste time with sample size as a limitation. It’s almost always a limitation.\nSometimes this is integrated with limitations, but it is nice to point to future directions. What are the next questions/projects that logically follow from this one?\nFinally, it is usually nice to end with a conclusion. This summarizes the findings, highlights the key implications, and ends with a strong conclusion that can be drawn from the study.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nMake sure to acknowledge funding sources, assistants who helped collect the data, and people who gave advice or reviewed the manuscript. Notice there are only two `e’s in Acknowledgments (in American spelling).\n\n\n\nPro tips\n\nKeep the presentation of hypotheses/research questions consistent throughout Methods, Results, and Discussion\nTo minimize passive voice, read your paper backwards looking specifically for passive voice.\n\n\n\n\n8.3.3 Before submitting journal articles\nThere are a few things to consider and do before submitting our papers. We will want to post all data and analysis scripts to publicly via Open Science Framework and/or GitHub and include links in our papers. Also, in most cases, Jeff will want to submit a preprint of the article to a preprint server (e.g., PsyArXiv, bioRxiv, or OSF Preprints) before submit the article to a journal. We also need to write a short cover letter and think about potential reviewers to suggest (going through the bibliography is often useful for generating reviewer ideas).",

    "text": "9.2 How to give a talk\n\nThings to think about before starting\n\nWhat will be the aim of this talk? Are you giving a tutorial, job talk, research overview, or a deep dive into a particular study or set of studies? Or do you want feedback on an upcoming project?\nWho is your audience?\nHow much time do you have? How much time do you have/want for questions?\n\n\n\nThe slides\nPresentation files\n\nIf you don’t need to embed videos, consider using PDFs instead of PowerPoint slides. Even if you do use PowerPoint, save a PDF version and have your video files available just in case.\nFind out if your projector/screen is 4x3 or 16x9, and set up your presentation to match (use 16x9 if possible)\nHave your presentation on a USB but also email it to yourself to have an easily accessible copy. Don’t rely on Box or other cloud services because logging in may be tricky.\nEmbed your fonts in your PowerPoint file.\n\nStructure and content\n\nGeneral\n\nOutline your talk into sections before you start making slides.\nFor study-based talks, organize them into Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion/Summary.\nUse consistent ordering of content throughout your presentation. If you introduce topic/hypothesis A, B, and C in the introduction, present them in order A, B, C in the methods, results, and discussion.\n\nPreliminaries\n\nTitle slides should not be too cluttered but should have the title, your name (possibly co-authors, but they can be on another slide), affiliation, and social media handles (especially Twitter—to allow the audience to tag you in any tweets during the talk)\nConsider having your acknowledgments slide next. This (1) makes clear from the start that it is a group endeavor (2) gets this item out of the way early so if you run out of time, you’ve been able to acknowledge the group, and (3) prevents the gap from your conclusions to questions that would occur if you have them at the end. Note: Do not belabor the acknowledgments and read off every person and/or funding agency unless there are just a few. Use funding agency icons rather than writing out their names.\nConsider having an outline slide, though this may not be necessary for short talks.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe introduction to your presentation should briefly cover the basic background of your topic. Just give the audience the minimal introduction needed to understand the motivation for your talk. And focus on why the audience should care about your talk rather than exhaustively reviewing previous literature. Your introduction should be about 15% of your total talk time.\nCiting literature in your introduction is acceptable, but keep it to a minimum and consider putting citations at the bottom of the slide instead of embedded in sentences (footnotes work well for this).\nInclude one or more slides with the research question and the specific hypotheses explicitly written out.\n\nMethods\n\nThe methods section also does not need to be exhaustive. The audience does not need to be able to replicate your work, just understand what you’ve done.\nInclude images or videos of the procedure.\n\nResults\n\nThe bulk of your presentation should focus on your results. Take your time carefully explaining your results.\nUse graphs rather than tables when possible.\nEnd subsections with summary slide.\n\nDiscussion\n\nKeep discussion relatively short. Start with overall summary of results. Next, discuss implications. Limitations are usually not necessary in a presentation, but they can be useful sometimes. Consider describing future directions. End the discussion with a Take Away slide that reiterates the 1-3 points that you want the audience to walk away with.\nOn the final slide, include all of your contact info: name, email address, social media handles. This is the slide that you leave on the screen when answering questions. You don’t need a slide that says Thanks! or Questions?\n\n\nStyle\n\nText\n\nLimit the amount of text on a slide. There is no need to write in full sentences.\nUse LARGE, readable fonts. All text should be at least 18 point and anything you actually want people to read should be at least 24 point.\nDon’t use red fonts. Ever.\nUse abbreviations sparingly. People forget what abbreviations mean unless they are standard (e.g., DNA). Almost all abbreviations you might use are not standard, so don’t use them. Unlike in a paper, if an audience member misses when you define an abbreviation, they cannot go back to find what it means.\nUse consistent labels/words throughout the presentation.\n\nFigures\n\nMake your graphs large, preferably 1-2 per slide. Use large fonts for the x and y axes and legend labels.\nIf you use color to distinguish data, use color-blind safe color palletes. Also, distinguish different data with different symbols or line types.\nUse consistent sizes, aspect ratios, labels, and colors for graphs. If red and blue mean female and male in one graph, don’t use them to mean Condition 1 and Condition 2 in another graph.\n\nSlides\n\nConsider color-coding different hypotheses/topics in your talk.\nIf you are talking about your published work, put a citation of the work on the bottom of each slide that refers to the work.\n\n\n\n\nThe presenter\nAudience\n\nTypically, you want to assume your audience is smart people who know nothing about your topic.\nFace your audience!\nTalk slowly and clearly and maintain a consistent volume that people in the back of the room can hear.\nDo not read your slide text.\n\nKick-off\n\nDo not start your talk by reading your title. Feel free to summarize what you’re covering in different words, though (e.g., “Today, I’ll talk about…”).\nPractice what you’ll say on your first slide. Otherwise, it can sometimes be awkward.\n\nSlides\n\nEvery time you have a new set of x and y axes on graphs, explain the axes. Consider starting with a blank graph to describe the axes and explain predictions before revealing the data.\nDo not put massive tables or graphs on a slide and say “I know you can’t read this, but…”. If the audience cannot read a table or graph, don’t use it.\n\nExtras\n\nIf you’re nervous and are using a laser pointer, use two hands to point the laser—it will steady the laser.\nIf you’re using a slide advancer, do not repeatedly apologize for pushing the wrong button. One apology is more than sufficient.\nHave a glass or bottle of water at the podium and don’t be afraid to take a moment to take a drink.\nIf you have technical difficulties and a video does not play or the presentation freezes. Do not apologize and get flustered. We’ve all experienced this. Simply work on trying to fix the technical problem.\n\nQuestions\n\nDefer to your host as to whether you field the questions or someone else does.\nDo not interrupt when someone is asking a question. Let them finish speaking before you start to answer.\nRepeat the question back to the questioner to make sure that you understood it and to ensure that others have heard it. If they ask multiple questions, feel free to ask them to repeat questions that you may have forgotten.\nTry to answer succinctly and pay attention if you start to ramble. Pay attention to how much time you have and shorten answers as you get closer to the end of your time.\nFeel free to ask if you have answered their question.\n\n\n\nResources\n\nTen simple rules for short and swift presentations\nTen simple rules for making good oral presentations\nHow to give a great scientific talk\nHow to give a good talk\nTen secrets to giving a good scientific talk",
