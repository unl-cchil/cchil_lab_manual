This is the lab manual for the [Canine Cognition and Human Interaction Lab](https://dogcog.unl.edu). CCHIL seeks to understand how dogs behave and process information in their world as well as how interacting with dogs influences human behavior and psychology.

The aim of this lab manual is to spell out expectations, policies, and resources for members of CCHIL. All lab members are expected to read the lab manual and attest to understanding it's content.
