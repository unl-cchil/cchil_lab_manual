[![](media/cchil_logo_red_wide.png)](https://dogcog.unl.edu)

Welcome to the [Canine Cognition and Human Interaction Lab](https://dogcog.unl.edu)! 

This lab is led by [Jeff Stevens](https://jeffreyrstevens.quarto.pub/), Susan J. Rosowski Professor in the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.unl.edu/) and the [Center for Brain, Biology & Behavior](https://cb3.unl.edu/) at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](http://www.unl.edu/).

## Mission statement  {-}
**The mission of CCHIL is to use biological and psychological approaches to understand dog behavior with the aim of improving how owners and handlers train, work with, and live with dogs.** 

CCHIL is committed to robust, transparent, and open science in all of our research endeavors and to disseminating our work to the general public via outreach activities.

## Lab priorities {-}

* The safety, security, and well-being of lab personnel, human participants, and animal subjects.
* An inclusive working environment that respects diverse perspectives; seeks empathic understanding of diverse experiences, including discrimination, bias, and privilege; and fosters opportunities for underrepresented students to participate in science.
* The integrity and transparency of data and the replicability of data analyses.

This lab manual was inspired by several others and borrows heavily from them (e.g., [@Mehr.2020]; [lab manual](https://handbook-public.themusiclab.org/) and [this one](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual)). It’s also a work in progress. If you have ideas about things to add or what to clarify, talk to me (Jeff, the PI).

When you join the lab, you’re expected to read this manual and are responsible for its content.
